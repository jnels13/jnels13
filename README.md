### Hi, I'm Joe, from Charlotte, North Carolina (U.S.)

I'm an ML engineer with over a decade's experience as a practicing trial attorney. As so much of the practice of law focuses on language and its syntax, I've enjoyed learning NLP and developing NLP projects -- including as it may be applied in the legal field.  I'm especially interested in collaborating on projects in this area.  I've also worked in healthcare, insurance, and aviation; any projects in these areas would also be fun to work on.

I currently work with Omdena as a project manager and ML engineer. Omdena was my first experience in a __collaborative__, bottom-up team; it has been a wonderful experience, and working with the world-wide group of collaborators has been a treat. If you're not familiar with Omdena, check them out: www.Omdena.com. 

Outside of work, I've been learning French for a few years now and love it; my streak on DuoLingo is _awesome_. I also love to play the bagpipes and a few other, quieter instruments.
