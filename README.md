### Hi, I'm Joe, from Charlotte, North Carolina (U.S.)

I'm an ML engineer and data lover, with work experience in the insurance, aviation, and healthcare fields, primarily as a practicing attorney. Whatever the problem, I think outside of the box, coming up with creative solutions that get the job done. I currently also work with Omdena as a project manager and ML engineer. I've found a lot of parallels between work as an ML engineer and the law; both share the need to be detail oriented (commas can make a big difference ...), to plan at the forest-level and execute at the tree-level, and to know the technical side inside-out while being able to educate a non-technical audience. Because so much of the practice of law focuses on language and its syntax, I've enjoyed developing NLP projects, including applications in the legal field.     

Omdena was my first experience on a collaborative, bottom-up team; it has been a wonderful experience, and working with the distributed group of collaborators has been a treat. I started as an assistant project manager on the <a href="https://omdena.com/projects/climate-change/">Leveraging Machine Learning to Minimize Climate Change Impacts </a>project, then moved to project owner on the <a href="https://omdena.com/projects/ai-africa/">Building an ML Model to Predict Future Infrastructure Needs of Africa for Policy Makers</a>, and then (most recently) worked as a machine-learning engineer on the <a href="https://omdena.com/projects/bias/"> Detecting Bias in Articles Through Natural Language Processing</a> project. 

Outside of work, I've been learning French for a few years now and really enjoy it.  My streak on DuoLingo is _awesome_, just don't speak too fast ... I also love to play the bagpipes and a few other, quieter instruments. I hold an FAA Private Pilot's license, and I'm very interested in machine-learning work in the aviation space.
