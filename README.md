### Hi, I'm Joe Nelson, an Data Engineer in Charlotte, North Carolina (U.S.)

I'm an Data engineer with work experience in the insurance, aviation, and healthcare fields, among others. Whatever the problem, I think outside of the box, coming up with creative solutions that get the job done. I have experience working with large structured and unstructured data, extracting features and labels from text, and providing insightful analysis before engaging in modeling. I currently also work with Omdena as a project manager and ML engineer. 

I practiced law for well over a decade, and I've found a lot of parallels between work as an ML engineer and the law; both share the need to be detail oriented (commas can make a big difference ...), to plan at the forest-level and execute at the tree-level, and to know the technical side inside-out while being able to educate a non-technical audience. Because so much of the practice of law focuses on language and its syntax, I've enjoyed developing NLP projects, including applications in the legal field.     

Omdena was my first experience on a collaborative, bottom-up team, distributed group of collaborators. I started as an assistant project manager on the <a href="https://omdena.com/projects/climate-change/" target="_blank">Leveraging Machine Learning to Minimize Climate Change Impacts </a>project, then moved to project owner on the <a href="https://omdena.com/projects/ai-africa/" target="_blank">Building an ML Model to Predict Future Infrastructure Needs of Africa for Policy Makers</a>, and then (most recently) worked as a machine-learning engineer on the <a href="https://omdena.com/projects/bias/" target="_blank"> Detecting Bias in Articles Through Natural Language Processing</a> project.
